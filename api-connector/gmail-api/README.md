# Gmail Connector
The **Gmail Connector** script is a powerful tool designed to interface with the Gmail API, allowing users to programmatically manage their email accounts. This script simplifies the process of accessing, sending, and organizing emails, making it an essential utility for developers looking to integrate Gmail functionalities into their applications.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Utilizes OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication, ensuring that user credentials are handled safely. The script prompts users to log in to their Google account and grant necessary permissions.
  
- **Email Retrieval**: Fetches a list of emails from the user's inbox, allowing for filtering based on various criteria such as date, sender, and subject. Users can easily access their email data for analysis or processing.

- **Email Sending**: Enables users to compose and send new emails directly from the script. This feature supports adding attachments, making it convenient for sending documents or images.

- **Label Management**: Users can create, delete, and modify labels in their Gmail account. This helps in organizing emails effectively, allowing for better management of incoming messages.

- **Error Handling**: The script includes robust error handling to manage common issues such as authentication failures, network errors, and API quota limits, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## How to Use
1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have **Python** (version 3.6 or higher) and **pip** installed on your system.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required libraries by executing the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
   ```

3. **Obtain OAuth 2.0 Credentials**: 
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a new project or select an existing one.
   - Navigate to the **APIs & Services** > **Credentials** section.
   - Click on **Create Credentials** and select **OAuth client ID**.
   - Configure the consent screen and download the credentials file (JSON format).
   - Save the credentials file in your project directory, renaming it to `credentials.json`.

4. **Run the Script**: Execute the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python gmail-connector.py
   ```
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to authenticate your Google account. A browser window will open for you to log in and grant permissions.

5. **Explore the Functionality**: Once authenticated, you can use the script to:
   - Retrieve emails by modifying the parameters in the script.
   - Send emails by providing the recipient's address, subject, and body content.
   - Manage labels by calling the respective functions included in the script.
